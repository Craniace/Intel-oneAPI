## A Brief of the Prototype:
  This section must include UML Daigrms and prototype description
  
## Tech Stack: 
   List Down all technologies used to Build the prototype **Clearly mentioning IntelÂ® AI Analytics Toolkits, it's libraries and the SYCL/DCP++ Libraries used**
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed
  
## What I Learned:
   In this road sign detection project utilizing oneAPI, our team gained significant insights and expertise in several key areas. We developed a strong proficiency in oneAPI integration, computer vision techniques, dataset collection and annotation, model training, performance evaluation, error analysis, and real-world application considerations. This project honed our skills in handling oneAPIs effectively, implementing advanced computer vision algorithms, optimizing models, and addressing practical challenges. Overall, the project enriched our knowledge and capabilities in road sign detection, empowering us to tackle complex computer vision tasks with confidence and expertise.
